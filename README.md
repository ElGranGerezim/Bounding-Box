# Overview

Bounding Box is a physics based puzzle platformer. The goal is to bounce a box off of the edges off the screen, which you control, to manuver it to the goal.
WASD to move the camera. Space to enable "De-Bounce", where bounces slow the box instead of speeding it up.

The idea came from a desire for a platformer where you don't control the character directly. This is a simpler version than what I envision it eventually becoming,
just a way for me to get started learning how to use Unity.
